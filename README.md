Python assignment
Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
Key Features:

User Input:
The program prompts the user to input two numbers. These inputs are converted to floating-point values to support both integers and decimal numbers.

Arithmetic Operations:
The program performs the following mathematical operations:

Addition: Adds the two numbers.

Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.

Multiplication: Multiplies the two numbers.

Division: Divides the first number by the second. If the second number is zero, it handles the case gracefully by displaying an appropriate message instead of causing an error.

The output:
Enter the first number10
Enter the second number5
Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0


Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.
Key Features
 User Input
The program prompts the user to input their first name and second name.
Both inputs are captured as strings and later used to generate a personalized message.

 Personalized Greeting
After collecting the user’s inputs, the program constructs and displays a friendly greeting message that includes the user’s full name.
Example:
Hello, Soham Das! Welcome to the Python program.

 String Manipulation
The program demonstrates basic string concatenation and formatted output using Python’s f-strings, allowing for clean and readable code.

 Error-Free Execution
The program handles user input safely and runs without errors under normal conditions.
Since all inputs are treated as text, it avoids common type conversion issues and ensures reliable execution in any Python 3 environment.

Educational Purpose
This project is designed as a simple introduction to fundamental Python concepts, including:
•	Using the input() function
•	Working with variables
•	Combining and formatting strings
•	Displaying messages using print()
The output: Enter your first name Soham
Enter your second name Das
Hello, Soham Das!  Welcome to the Python progam.


Multiplication: 50.0
Divison: 2.0
